# problem: Fails to Connect
error: "Connection refused. Retrying..."  
affects: Ubuntu >=23.04  
driver: libvirt

This only seems to happen on Ubuntu 23.04 and above. It happens on both Fedora & Ubuntu hosts! Affects all box sources: bento, generic, roboxes.

# Solution:
none yet. Just use Ubuntu 22.10 until a resolution is found.
